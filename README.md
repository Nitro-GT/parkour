# Nitrowo's Fe Parkour Addon
This is a WIP addon/edit of FE Parkour V2, it will have more features such as ceiling hanging soon
Loadstrings Below:
Run on respawn (has issues with wallrunning):
```
_G.Transparency = 0.25 -- This changes the transparency of your limbs. You can change this from 0 - 1
_G.Walkspeed = 45 -- This increases the max speed that you can reach. You can change this from 35 - inf
_G.HideAccessories = false -- This makes your hats the same transparency as your limbs. You can change this to true or false
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nitrowo-rblx/parkour/main/parkour"))()
```
Run manually on respawn (has no issues but has to be manually executed each time):
```
_G.Transparency = 0.25 -- This changes the transparency of your limbs. You can change this from 0 - 1
_G.Walkspeed = 45 -- This increases the max speed that you can reach. You can change this from 35 - inf
